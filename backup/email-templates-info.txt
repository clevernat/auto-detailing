The email-templates directory contained HTML templates for EmailJS.
These templates are stored on the EmailJS server and are not directly used by the website code.
They were removed to clean up the project structure.

Templates included:
- booking-template-admin.html
- booking-template-client.html
- booking-template.html
- contact-template-admin.html
- contact-template-client.html
- contact-template.html
- newsletter-template-admin.html
- newsletter-template-client.html
- newsletter-template.html

If you need to reference these templates in the future, you can find them in your EmailJS dashboard
or recreate them based on the parameters used in the emailjs.js file.
